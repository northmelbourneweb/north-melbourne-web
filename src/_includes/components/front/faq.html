              Unlike WordPress or Wix, we provide 100% hand-coded websites

              PageSpeed refers to the speed at which your website loads. A
              higher PageSpeed score means your site loads faster, which
              improves user experience and can boost your search engine
              rankings. We ensure our websites achieve a score of 90+ to
              maximize performance and user engagement.
