                            Why should I choose you? Could I not just build a WordPress or WiX website?

                        You could - in the same way you could buy a suit off-the-rack instead of going to a tailor. While going for the suit off-the-rack may be quicker and cheaper, it will often require adjustments and, ultimately, compromises.

                        Instead, we take the "tailor-made" approach. We build a website that will be the perfect fit for your business, reflecting it's style and enhancing it's best features, all while making you feel confident and unique.

                            What is a "PageSpeed Score"?

                        A Pagespeed score is a report on your website's performance, given by Google's Pagespeed tool. It grades how quickly your site loads and how efficiently it runs, on a scale from 0 to 100. The higher the score, the faster and more user-friendly your site is.

                        A top-notch Pagespeed Score means your visitors enjoy a seamless, speedy experience, which keeps them engaged and happy, while also helping your site climb higher in search results, leading to more opportunities and conversions. Why don't you give your website and our website a test and see how we compare?

                            Why do you custome code websites?

                        Because we believe in creating something extraordinary, instead of settling for a solution that eveyone else is using. Writing everything from scratch, line-by-line, ensures that we can say "yes" to pretty much any request you ask for, while maintaining high performance and unbreakable security.

                        Without the likes of Wix or WordPress, some clients may ask "how can I make an update to my website"? That's the neat part - you don't have to. You didn't start a business to fight a page builder - you're too busy with day-to-day operations to worry about that. All our monthly packages come with unlimited edits and support. Just drop us a message and we'll do the rest.

                            Are the "unlimited edits" truly unlimited?
                        </span>

                    <p class="item-p">
                        Absolutely! It would be unfair of us to charge thousands for a top-of-the-line website, then charge even more for a simple text change when you're unable to edit it yourself, due to the custom-coded nature of the site. That's why any changes to existing pages or content on your website are all included in our monthly packages - no hidden fees, no surprise charges.

                        For entirely new pages or significant new features as your business grows, we charge a modest fee upfront on a per-page basis. But once those new pages are live, they fall under the same unlimited edits policy. So whether you're updating your offering, tweaking your messaging, or refreshing your content for seasonal offers, we've got you covered.

                            Why should my website be accessible?

                        Accessiblity is the act of making sure your website is usable by everyone. Even those with disabilities who have to use a screen reader or have colour-blindedness. Did you know that lack of care to website accessibility cost Domino's Pizza millions in fighting a web accessibility lawsuit?

                        Many agencies claim to create accessible websites, but these fail a simple screen reader test. We don't do that. All websites include a dark mode and are tested with screen readers, colour-blind emulators, link-checkers, and other assistive technologies to ensure compliance with WCAGs 2.2 guidelines (Level AA). That's one less worry for you to think about.

                            Why are there no upfront costs? Is there a minimum contract length?

                        We think it's unfair to hide premium web products behind a huge fee. On top of that, a custom-coded website can be difficult to make changes if you don't have the technical know-how to make edits (though we are more than happy to cater to those preferring a lump-sum means of payment). That's why we bundle everything you need into one easy-to-understand fee.

                        We do have a minimum contract length of 6 months. However, when considering the monthly subscription against the lump-sum value, we don't actually break-even until 15 to 16 months into the contract. That's how confident we are in our methods and that you'll partner with us for years to come.
