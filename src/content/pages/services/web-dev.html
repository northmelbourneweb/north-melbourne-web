            <h1 class="title">Melbourne Web Design for <span class="color-text">Small Businesses</span></h1>
            <p>Today, small businesses need more than just word-of-mouth and traditional ads. A professional website is crucial to stand out in a market full of choices and short attention spans.</p>
            <p>At <strong>North Melbourne Web</strong>, we focus on <strong>web design</strong> for small businesses, helping turn visitors into customers. Our websites are both attractive and high-performing. With our subscription plans, we don’t just build websites — we become your partner in success. Check out our services to see how we can help your Melbourne business grow.</p>

            <h2>Why Choose North Melbourne Web?</h2>
            <p>In the digital world, your website is essential. It’s your online storefront, showing off your services and building trust.</p>
            <p>We know how to create custom websites. We write every line of code ourselves, avoiding generic templates to meet the specific needs of Melbourne small businesses.</p>

            <h3>Say Goodbye to WordPress Hassles</h2>
            <p>Many businesses start with platforms like Wix or WordPress but soon face limitations, whether it’s clunky interfaces or not getting the look they want. At <strong>North Melbourne Web</strong>, we solve these problems by delivering custom websites that fit your brand.</p>

            <h3>Creativity Without Compromise</h2>
            <p>Standing out online is vital, but it’s not always easy. Our Melbourne-based designers create unique, on-brand websites that avoid cookie-cutter templates, giving your business a distinct online presence.</p>

            <h3>Transparent Pricing, No Hidden Fees</h2>
            <p>Businesses who give up in the fight against page builders may try an agency to rescue them from their worries. However, they may run into hidden fees, and exorbitant hourly rates for what otherwise would be a simple change.</p>
