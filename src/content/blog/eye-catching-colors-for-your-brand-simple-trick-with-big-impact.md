By adjusting the Saturation and Lightness just right, you can transform any color into a standout shade that looks great on both white and black backgrounds. No more guessing or trial and error!

**Here's the secret:**

1. Open an **HSL color picker**. I use [https://hslpicker.com ](https://hslpicker.com)
2. (Optional) Copy and paste your current color **hex code** in bottom left box starting with #.
3. Adjust the **Saturation slider** (the second slider from the top) to a value between 80 and 100. This controls how vibrant the color is.
4. Adjust the **Lightness slider** (the third slider from the top) to a value between 60 and 80. This controls how bright or dark the color is.
5. Adjust your desire color with the **Hue slider** (first one on top) to your liking. You can ignore the last slider.

By following these steps, you'll ensure your chosen color stands out, no matter the background!
